# Machine-Learning-Flappy-Bird
NEAT Neural Network, learns how to play Flappy Bird! Programmed in Python.

The python file contains all of the game programming.

The folder, imgs, holds all of the images used to create the game.

The file, config-feedforward.txt is a text file that contains configurations for the NEAT Neural Network. I've added comments to areas that
I made changes to, however more about the configurations can be learned by reading documentation on: https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html

The file, neat_concept.txt is a text file goes over what is needed for our Neural Network to learn. It also gives some insight about why
certain variables are augmented throughout testing (my) process.
