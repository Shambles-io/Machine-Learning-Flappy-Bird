INPUTS - What we give to the neural network
    Bird Y - Bird only moves in y-direction
    Top Pipe - Distance between bird and NEXT top pipe
    Bottom Pipe - Distance between bird and NEXT bottom pipe


OUTPUTS - Either we jump, or do not jump


ACTIVATION FUNCTION - What activates our neural network
    TanH - Hyperbolic tangent function (Helps to look at a tanh function)
         - Allows us to "squish" our output neuron value(s) between -1 and 1
         - If our value if greater than 0.5, we will jump ; else no jump


POPULATION SIZE - How many birds we will have running each population (arbitrary)
    Higher number of birds increases our chances for random connections and complexity
    Generations
        Gen0 - 100 Birds (controlled by random neural networks)
             - We take the best of Gen0, breed them, and create Gen1
        Gen1 - 100 Birds (controlled by neural networks "trained" from Gen0)
             - We take the best of Gen1, breed them, and create Gen2
        Gen2 - 100 Birds (controlled by neural networks "trained" from Gen1)


FITNESS SIZE - How we grow and how the birds get better - Want to breed the best possible
    Distance
        - Each bird gets a score based on how far they travel before "dying"
        - We want the breed the birds with the best scores in each generation


MAX GENERATIONS - At some point if our AI has not beat the game, we should know when to give up
    - Setting max generations keeps the network from breeding generations indefinitely
    - Setting ours to 30 for now
